# Unity Shader Studies

Welcome to my Unity Shader Studies repository! This repository contains my experiments and learning materials related to Unity shaders. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced shader developer, you may find something valuable here.

## About Shaders

Shaders are a powerful tool for manipulating the visual aspects of your Unity projects. They allow you to create stunning visual effects, optimize rendering performance, and achieve various artistic and technical goals.

## Getting Started

If you're new to shader programming, I recommend starting with the basics. Here are some resources to help you kickstart your journey:

- [Unity Shader Programming Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Shaders.html): The official documentation is a great place to understand the fundamentals of shader programming in Unity.

- [Shader Development from Scratch](https://youtu.be/gLWe_Wzc8Xc) (Video Tutorial): This video tutorial provides a step-by-step introduction to creating shaders from scratch. It covers the basics and is beginner-friendly.

- [Introduction to Shader Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPJQuD93-Ks&ab_channel=GabrielAguiarProd) (Video Tutorial): Shader Graph is a visual tool for creating shaders in Unity. This tutorial introduces Shader Graph and its capabilities.

## Examples

In this repository, you'll find a collection of shader examples and projects that demonstrate various shader techniques and effects. Feel free to explore, modify, and use these as a learning resource.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have shader-related projects, tips, or improvements to share, please feel free to open a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!

## Resources

Here are some additional resources for diving deeper into Unity shader programming:
